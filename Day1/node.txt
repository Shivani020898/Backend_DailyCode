1....what is node....

node is not a language it used javascript internally 
broweser have h chrome6 engine there is a run time enviromenet 

that is server side enviroemnt (where is javascript code)
file create write, api create, coonction with data base

code and syntax is similar but not exactly 

open source (code avialbe in intrnet)

node js mostly used API (when you create major projct you should have to create api) so we can connect database web apps and also mobile apps

node js is super fast for api rather than other language and you do not need to learn other languages

with node and javascript you will be become full stack developer

2....what are the client server sides..?

clint req to sever .......google.com
server respond and send you data the data

again you clicked somwhere and you send req and server give you respone so this architecture will continue

client side language -html css js so we can display our website

server side languages - its provide coonection with dataBase ,store the data like nodejs,pyhthon,java 

developer make api with nodejs so we can coonect server with client

it can make api for web ,android and IOS

3...download Node JS

npm is helping package

Fundamental of Node.JS


function home(){

    console.log('welcome to home js')

}
home()

if we want resuse  create another file

common js 
module.exports = home;

card.js
const home  = require('./home')

home()
now run card.js

error
 Cannot use import statement outside a module

 (npm init for initialize package.json)


inbuilt
const os = require('os')
